# Pattern-programs
My programming journey started with printing different kinds of patterns. I feel crazy about these. Here are some of them
Since these are my first programs, these are my friends.

My way of approach:

I first draw pattern on paper.
Next check for each row, what are needs, like how many spaces, of stars.
After analyzing I find a logical sequence of each character in each row.
That's it. Then I start to code.
